## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User fills form] --> B[Live resume preview]
    B --> C{Export or Publish?}
    C -->|Export| D[Encrypt + sign HTML]
    D --> E[Send to backend serverless]
    E --> F[Generate PDF Puppeteer]
    F --> G[Return base64 PDF to user]
    C -->|Publish| H[Encrypt and save to DB]
    H --> I[Return unique, sharable URL]
    I --> J[Resume can be edited/decrypted via URL+key]
```

- **Build**: Fill out the form, see instant preview, and edit formatting directly.
- **Export**: Resume HTML is encrypted and signed, sent to a serverless backend, rendered to PDF with Puppeteer, and returned as a secure download.
- **Publish**: Resume is encrypted and stored in the cloud. You get a unique, encrypted link to revisit and edit your resume from any device.
- **Access**: When you open a published link, the resume is decrypted in your browser using the embedded key ‚Äî your data stays private.

## üîí Technical Details

### End-to-End Encryption

- All resume data is encrypted in the browser using AES (via `crypto-js`).
- When you publish or export, the data is encrypted with a randomly generated key.
- For published resumes, the key is embedded in the URL fragment (`#key=...`), never sent to the server.
- For PDF export, the HTML is encrypted and signed with a shared secret before being sent to the serverless function.

### Publishing & Editing

- Publishing stores the encrypted resume in a database (via Supabase).
- The returned link contains the resume ID and the encryption key.
- Only someone with the link (and key) can decrypt and edit the resume.

### PDF Export

- PDF export is handled by a Firebase Function (or any serverless endpoint) using Puppeteer and headless Chrome.
- The frontend sends encrypted HTML and a HMAC signature.
- The backend verifies the signature, decrypts the HTML, renders it to PDF, and returns a base64-encoded PDF.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```
VITE_EXPORT_API=https://your-cloud-function-url
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-cloud-function-url
VITE_SHARED_SECRET=your-shared-secret
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-supabase-url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
VITE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
VITE_UMAMI_SRC=https://cloud.umami.is/script.js
VITE_UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID=your-umami-website-id
```

### AI Enhancement Setup

For AI content enhancement features, you'll need to set up Google Gemini API:

1. Get a Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. For local development, add to `functions/.env`:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
   ```
3. For production, set Firebase Functions config:
   ```bash
   firebase functions:config:set gemini.api_key="your_gemini_api_key_here"
   ```

See [AI_SETUP.md](./AI_SETUP.md) for detailed setup instructions.

- `VITE_EXPORT_API`: URL of your deployed PDF export function
- `VITE_API_BASE_URL`: URL of your deployed function
- `VITE_SHARED_SECRET`: Secret used for encrypting/signing PDF export payloads
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL (for published resume storage)
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase anon/public API key
- `VITE_BASE_URL`: The base URL of your frontend app (e.g., http://localhost:5173)
- `VITE_UMAMI_SRC`: Umami script URL (cloud or self-hosted). Example: `https://cloud.umami.is/script.js`
- `VITE_UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID`: Your Umami website ID

---

## üì¶ Environment Example File

A `.env.example` file is provided in the project root. It lists all required environment variables for both local and Firebase PDF export, as well as Supabase integration.

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your values.
- For local PDF export, set `VITE_EXPORT_API` to `http://localhost:5001/export-pdf`.
- For Firebase/production, set `VITE_EXPORT_API` to your deployed function URL.
- Make sure `VITE_SHARED_SECRET` matches between frontend and backend.

Example:
```env
VITE_SHARED_SECRET=your-shared-secret
VITE_EXPORT_API=http://localhost:5001/export-pdf
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-supabase-url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
VITE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5173
VITE_UMAMI_SRC=https://cloud.umami.is/script.js
VITE_UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID=your-umami-website-id
```

## üìä Analytics (Umami)

This project uses **Umami** for privacy-friendly analytics.

- Analytics script is loaded dynamically from `src/components/Analytics.tsx`.
- Auto-tracking is disabled, and pageviews are tracked manually on route changes.
- Published resume pages (`/view/:id`) are intentionally **excluded** from analytics to protect user privacy.
- If `VITE_UMAMI_SRC` or `VITE_UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID` are missing, analytics is skipped entirely.

How to set up:
- Create a site in Umami and copy the website ID.
- Set `VITE_UMAMI_SRC` to your Umami script URL (Cloud: `https://cloud.umami.is/script.js` or your self-hosted URL).
- Set `VITE_UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID` to your website ID.

Event tracking:
- The app currently tracks only pageviews (excluding `/view/:id`). You can extend it to track custom events using `window.umami.track(eventName, data)` in your components.

## üñ®Ô∏è PDF Export: Local Development vs. Firebase

You can run the PDF export backend in two ways:

### 1. Local Development (using full Puppeteer)

For local testing and development, use the full Puppeteer package (no headless Chrome AWS Lambda required):

```sh
cd functions
npm run start:local
```

- The local server will run on [http://localhost:5001/export-pdf](http://localhost:5001/export-pdf)
- This uses your locally installed Chrome/Chromium for PDF generation.

### 2. Firebase Functions (Cloud/Emulator)

For production or cloud emulation, use the Firebase Functions setup (with `puppeteer-core` and `chrome-aws-lambda`):

```sh
cd functions
npm run start:firebase
```

- This runs the Firebase emulator for functions, matching the production environment.

## üé® Adding New Resume Templates

1. Add your template component to `src/templates/`.
2. Register it in `src/templates/index.ts` and `src/templates/config.ts`.
3. Add a preview image and description.
4. Submit a PR!
